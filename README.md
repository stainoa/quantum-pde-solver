# quantum-pde-solver
This project introduces a quantum algorithm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by combining an upwind spatial discretization with a quantum algorithm for ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The approach transforms PDEs into ODEs and makes use of the quantum amplitude estimation to compute approximate solutions efficiently.

The codes are temporarily unavailable and are currently being formatted for readability and usability. 

If you have any questions, please contact the corresponding author in the interim.
